# Session Artifacts

This folder is where capture pipelines and agents store session artifacts.

Recommended structure per session:

- `events.jsonl` — append-only event stream
- `frames/` — timestamped screenshots
- `clips/` — trimmed clips
- `exports/` — post-session deliverables (show notes, clip list, etc.)
