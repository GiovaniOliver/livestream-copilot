# Skill: Debate Fact-Check

## Purpose
Extract checkable claims, prioritize verification, and create neutral evidence cards.

## Procedure
1. Convert statements into atomic claims.
2. Tag each claim: factual | prediction | value judgement | rhetorical.
3. Only factual claims enter the verification queue.
4. Create an evidence card:
   - claimId
   - neutral summary
   - what would validate/refute it
   - sources (links/citations) when available
   - status: unverified | partial | supported | disputed
5. Never present unverified claims as confirmed facts.
