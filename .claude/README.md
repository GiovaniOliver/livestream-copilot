# Claude Code System Pack

This directory is the automation pack:
- `commands/` — slash commands to run workflow actions
- `skills/` — reusable procedures (brand voice, clip scoring, debate triage)
- `subagents/` — role definitions (social producer, scribe, moderator)
- `hooks/` — hook scripts/templates for session lifecycle

Copy/merge these into your Claude Code project as needed.
