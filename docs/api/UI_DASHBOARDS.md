# Workflow Dashboards

This product intentionally uses **different visual metaphors** per workflow.

Desktop is canvas-first (boards/graphs). Mobile is review-first (lists and quick actions).

## Shared primitives (all dashboards)
- **Moments**: timestamped segments (auto or manual)
- **Artifacts**: clips, frames, transcript excerpts
- **Outputs**: posts, beats, claims, evidence cards, chapters, tasks
- **Links**: relationships between items
