# Dead Code Analysis Report

Generated: 2026-01-22

## Summary

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Unused Files | 2 | DELETED |
| Duplicate Code | 1 | DELETED |
| Debug/Log Files | 10 | DELETED |
| Unused Dependencies | 0 | None found |

## Cleanup Applied

- Deleted `docs/logs/` directory (10 files, ~1.2MB)
- Deleted `packages/shared/src/schemas/eventSchemas.ts` (unused/duplicate schemas)
- Deleted `packages/shared/src/types.ts` (unexported types)
- Deleted `packages/shared/dist/schemas/eventSchemas.*` (compiled artifacts)

**Build verification:** All apps compile successfully after cleanup.

---

## SAFE - Safe to Delete

These files can be safely removed without affecting functionality.

### 1. Development Log Files (`docs/logs/`)

**Location:** `docs/logs/`

**Files:**
- `chat.json` (565KB)
- `notification.json` (12KB)
- `post_tool_use.json` (247KB)
- `pre_compact.json` (7KB)
- `pre_tool_use.json` (18KB)
- `session_start.json` (7KB)
- `status_line.json` (309KB)
- `stop.json` (10KB)
- `subagent_stop.json` (25KB)
- `user_prompt_submit.json` (27KB)

**Total Size:** ~1.2MB

**Reason:** These are Claude Code hook development logs from December 2024. They contain debugging data and are not required for application functionality.

**Recommendation:** Delete entire `docs/logs/` directory

---

## CAUTION - Review Before Deletion

### 1. Unused Schema File

**File:** `packages/shared/src/schemas/eventSchemas.ts`

**Exports:**
- `WorkflowSchema` (DUPLICATE - also in session.ts)
- `CaptureModeSchema` (DUPLICATE - also in session.ts)
- `BaseEventSchema` (UNUSED)
- `MarkerClipStartSchema` (UNUSED)
- `MarkerClipEndSchema` (UNUSED)
- `MediaClipSavedSchema` (UNUSED)
- `AnyEvent` type (UNUSED)

**Analysis:**
- File is exported via `index.ts` but no imports found in codebase
- `WorkflowSchema` and `CaptureModeSchema` are duplicated in `session.ts`
- Other schemas appear to be an older event format not currently used

**Recommendation:** Delete file after verifying no external consumers

### 2. Unused Types File

**File:** `packages/shared/src/types.ts`

**Exports:**
- `Workflow` type
- `CaptureMode` type
- `OutputCategory` type

**Analysis:**
- File exists but is NOT exported from `packages/shared/src/index.ts`
- Types are defined but never imported anywhere
- Similar types are inferred from Zod schemas elsewhere

**Recommendation:** Either export from index.ts if needed, or delete

---

## DANGER - Do Not Delete

The following were analyzed but should NOT be deleted:

### Generated Prisma Files

**Location:** `apps/desktop-companion/src/generated/prisma/`

**Reason:** Auto-generated by Prisma - required for database operations

### Build Artifacts

**Location:** `packages/shared/dist/`

**Reason:** Compiled output - required for package to work in monorepo

---

## Proposed Cleanup Actions

### Phase 1: Safe Deletions (No Testing Required)

```bash
# Delete development logs
rm -rf docs/logs/
```

### Phase 2: Code Cleanup (Requires Testing)

1. Delete `packages/shared/src/schemas/eventSchemas.ts`
2. Delete `packages/shared/src/types.ts`
3. Run `npm run build` to verify
4. Run tests if available

---

## Unused Dependencies Analysis

No unused dependencies detected in:
- `apps/desktop-companion/package.json`
- `apps/web/package.json`
- `apps/mobile/package.json`
- Root `package.json`

---

## Notes

- TypeScript compilation passes for all apps
- No test suite configured for automated verification
- Manual tools (knip, depcheck, ts-prune) produced no output in this environment
- Analysis performed via manual grep/import tracing
